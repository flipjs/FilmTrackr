## FilmTrackr Project
Using Angular and Node.js (MEAN)

## This app is for film camera enthusiasts, like me. Most of us, if not all,
have plenty of film cameras in our gear stash. Sometimes we lost track which film is in our
camera, and we need to know what kind, like film speed, is it B&W or color, is
it a slide film, etc. This FilmTrackr is for you!
